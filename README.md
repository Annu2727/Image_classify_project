# Image_classify_project
🍎 Fruit Classification using Deep Learning
This project implements a fruit classification model. The model is trained on a dataset of different fruit images, incorporating data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve accuracy and generalization.
🔧 Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
Resizing images to a fixed dimension

Normalization to scale pixel values

Cropping to focus on the main object

Rotation, flipping, and zooming for better generalization
📊 Model Evaluation
The model performance is assessed using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Achieved significant improvements over baseline results through optimized training and data preprocessing.

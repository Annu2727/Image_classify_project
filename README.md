# Image_classify_project
🍎 Fruit Classification using Deep Learning: 
This project implements a fruit classification model. The model is trained on a dataset of different fruit images, incorporating data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to improve accuracy and generalization.

🔧 Data Preprocessing & Augmentation:

1.Resizing images to a fixed dimension

2.Normalization to scale pixel values

3.Cropping to focus on the main object

4.Rotation, flipping, and zooming for better generalization

📊 Model Evaluation:

The model performance is assessed using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Achieved significant improvements over baseline results through optimized training and data preprocessing.
